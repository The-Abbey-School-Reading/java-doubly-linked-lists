# Example Java for Doubly Linked Lists

Feel free to play around a bit with this code. Here are some ideas:

- Create a few nodes and add them to both ends of a new doubly linked list
- Print your doubly linked list out using the .printList() method
- Remove your doubly linked list’s head or tail node
- Print your list again — were the right nodes removed?
- Remove a specific node from somewhere in the middle of the list, then print the list again. Did it work?
- We created our .removeByData() method by iterating from the head of the list to the tail. Do you think you could start at the tail and iterate backward? Try it!
